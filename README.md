# POV-Ray-matrices
POV-Ray v3.7 include file for working with matrices

All rotation matrices created with this library maintain consistency with POV-Ray's left-handed coordinate system convention.

NB: At the moment this library is Work In Progress, so it is not yet complete and things may suddenly change.
